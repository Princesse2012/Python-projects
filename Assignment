Assignment
Write a Python program that will print a table of Celsius temperatures and their Fahrenheit equivalents between 0 and 100 Celsius in increments of 10 degrees. Your program should include a function named convert_to_fahrenheit that takes a Celsius temperature and returns the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.

The formula used to convert a Celsius temperature to a Fahrenheit temperature is this:

Fahrenheit = 9.0/5.0 * Celsius + 32
